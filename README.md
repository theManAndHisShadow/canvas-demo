# About
At this branch, I would like to capture a somewhat logically complete state of the project, sort of a first version, if that’s even appropriate.<br>
<br>
Initially, the project was written in plain JS, avoiding the use of any external frameworks. It was a challenge that led to interesting and sometimes unusual solutions. I learned a lot from it. Now, however, it’s time to rebuild everything from a new foundation.

Project status: `transition to version 2` <br>
